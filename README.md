this is a template project to work with opengl. it includes stb to read and write images, glad to load opengl functions, glfw for the windowing system.
to build and run (this should be cross platform but I have only tested it on my windows machine)
1-add a build folder
2-move to the build folder and run cmake .. (first time only)
3-run cmake --build
by default cmake will build in debug mode so the executable will be found under build/Debug
